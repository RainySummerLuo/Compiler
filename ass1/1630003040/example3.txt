3A) What is the output?
EBRACE QUOTE WORD OBRACE FILENAME SEMICOLON EBRACE EBRACE

3B) Such a configuration file is obviously not grammatically correct, but

It only recognizes individual stream or characters as symbols, filename and words. It do not consider the grammar such that a "OBRACE" must comes with a "EBRACE" to end.
